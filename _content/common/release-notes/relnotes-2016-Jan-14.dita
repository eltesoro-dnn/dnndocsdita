                <p>The following updates are geared towards extension developers and theme designers:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Single Page Application (SPA) and MVC modules are now supported, so developers can create non-Webforms-based modules. Visual Studio 2015 templates for both types are also released.</li>
                    <li>The module settings API was updated to support strongly typed settings.</li>
                    <li>Incremental upgrade support is now possible through <b>SqlDataProvider</b>, cleanup files, and configuration merge files. This allows changes to the platform or third-party extensions without requiring a new versioned release.</li>
                    <li>Extension developers can now create admin and host pages through the DNN Manifest (.dnn).</li>
                    <li>Developers can now exclude individual CSS and/or JS files from being loaded or combined during minification through a new control.</li>
                    <li><b>Default.css</b> now has versioning support, which can be set by theme designers to reduce the CSS that their themes need to override.</li>
                    <li>Third party components (CodeMirror and Newtonsoft) were upgraded to newer versions.</li>
                    <li>DAL 2 is enhanced to add a fluent configuration API that allows developers to separate their data implementation details from their models.</li>
                    <li>The DNN Platform now uses Web API 2.0.</li>
                    <li>JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication support is added to allow developers a way to expose WebAPI services for consumption outside of the framework, such as mobile applications. <b>Warning:</b> This feature is still in beta.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Additional changes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A new image handler is exposed to developers to be used for profile pictures throughout the application.</li>
                    <li>CK Editor is the new default HTML provider in new installations (replacing the Telerik RadEditor as default).</li>
                    <li>A number of Administration modules (including Vendors, Site Log, Newsletters) were removed from the base installation.</li>
                    <li>A new default theme that uses Bootstrap 3 is now available.</li>
                    <li>The base project was converted from a Website Project (WSP) to a Web Application Project (WAP) to help reduce application startup time.</li>
                    <li>The page output caching provider was moved from Evoq to the DNN Platform.</li>
                    <li>Password resets now use the same token as long as it isn't expired. This means that, if the user clicks <b>Send password</b> multiple times quickly, only a single token will be generated.</li>
                    <li>Password inputs now allow 39 characters instead of 20.</li>
                    <li>The default robots.txt now allows client-side resources to be indexed.</li>
                    <li>Text used throughout the entire application were reviewed for consistency.</li>
                    <li>The Breadcrumb theme object now outputs schema.org markup.</li>
                    <li>Fixed: The issue where some platform functionality injected CSS files too late, so that they couldn't be modified by skin.css.</li>
                    <li>SMTP now supports TLS authentication.</li>
                </ul>
