00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:02,333
In this video,

2
00:00:02,333 --> 00:00:05,433
you will learn how to create a simple content type.

3
00:00:05,433 --> 00:00:07,766
You must be logged in as a content manager

4
00:00:07,766 --> 00:00:11,766
to access the Persona Bar options for Structured Content.

5
00:00:11,766 --> 00:00:16,232
In the Persona Bar, go to Manage, then Content.

6
00:00:16,233 --> 00:00:18,733
Go to the Content Types tab.

7
00:00:18,733 --> 00:00:22,999
DNN provides you with default Content Types that you can use.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,133
You can duplicate a default Content Type

9
00:00:25,133 --> 00:00:28,333
and then customize it according to your needs.

10
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:31,333
Or you can create your own custom Content Type

11
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:34,699
by clicking the Create Content Type button.

12
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:41,033
Enter the name of the new Content Type up here.

13
00:00:41,033 --> 00:00:43,433
In the Settings section of the left panel,

14
00:00:43,433 --> 00:00:45,899
you can modify the properties of the Content Type,

15
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:50,733
including its description and the icon to represent it.

16
00:00:50,733 --> 00:00:52,833
Under the Content tab, you'll find the canvas

17
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:56,799
where you drag and drop content fields.

18
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,133
You can modify the properties of the new field

19
00:00:59,133 --> 00:01:02,133
in the Settings section of the left panel.

20
00:01:02,133 --> 00:01:05,499
In the Validation tab, you can make the field required

21
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,600
or restrict what data is allowed.

22
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,933
When you're done with the field properties,

23
00:01:10,933 --> 00:01:14,333
close the left panel to add more fields.

24
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:18,999
Each type of field and each form of that field could have different properties.

26
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:24,366
You can change the properties again later,

27
00:01:24,366 --> 00:01:27,132
simply by clicking the field you want to edit.

28
00:01:27,133 --> 00:01:31,166
You can also duplicate or delete the field using these icons.

29
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:34,332
Duplicating the field copies the current settings.

30
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:36,099
When you're done adding and configuring fields

31
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,700
to your custom Content Type, click Save.

32
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,033
Your new Content Type is now available for use.
